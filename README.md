# Assignments from Andrew Ng's machine learning online course rewritten by Python

Here I gradually upload Python solutions for the exercises of the famous online [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course from _Andrew Ng_. For the educational purpose, here I try not only rewrite all original Matlab codes in Python but also implement corresponding algorithms in Scikit-learn as a comparison. Some problems are solved using different methods. Although this is part of a self-learning program but all comments are welcome!
