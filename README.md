# Assignments from Andrew Ng's machine learning online course rewritten using Python

Here I gradually upload Python solutions for the exercises of the famous online [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course from _Andrew Ng_. Like many other, this course introduced me into the ML and AI world. For the educational purpose, here I try not only rewrite all original Matlab codes in Python but also implement corresponding algorithms in Scikit-learn as a comparison. Some problems are solved using different methods.

* [Neural Networks](/notebooks/ex3_nn.ipynb)
